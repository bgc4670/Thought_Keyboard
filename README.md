# Thought_Keyboard
Type with your mind!

A project with NXT (Neurotechnology Exploration Team), an all-undergraduate research team at RIT (Project Lead: Forest).

The goal of this project is to give people with mobility disabilities the ability to easily use computers.
This is done with a dry EEG (ElectroEncephaloGram) ran through a BCI (Brain Control Interface) That translates the brainwaves in computer readable signals. This is translated through a Pylsl program (incomplete) into the Python Thought_Keyboard program.
The main libraries used are PyQT and pyautogui.

Things to do:
  1. Make it so the window does not refresh with every button press
  2. Add key to mouse functionality to move the cursor with digital inputs
  3. AESTHETICS (vision-impaired friendly)
  4. Make the pylsl program
  5. More human testing with input (probably involoving machine learning algorithms and developing "typing games" for proficiency)
  
Things Learned:
  1. A bit of C++ to translate QT docs to PyQT
  2. GUIs, specifically in python
