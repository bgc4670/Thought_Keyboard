# Thought_Keyboard
Type with your mind!

A project with NXT (Neurotechnology Exploration Team), an all-undergraduate research team at RIT (Project Lead: Forest).

The goal of this project is to give people with motor disabilities the ability to easily use computers.
This is done with a dry EEG (ElectroEncephaloGram) ran through a BCI (Brain Control Interface) that translates the brainwaves in computer readable signals. This is translated through a Pylsl program into the Python Thought_Keyboard program.
The main libraries used are PyQT and pyautogui.

Currently there are numerous issues with the program. The window needs to be made so that it does not refresh with every button press. The actual layout needs to be vision-impaired friendly as far as color and font size and such. More human testing with input (probably involoving machine learning algorithms and developing "typing games" for proficiency) is planned.
